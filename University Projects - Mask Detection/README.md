 
# image mask detection

This one is about some basic image processing. 

1. Chapter 0: INTRODUCTION 
  There are two part to this project. the first image processing problem is mask detection. meaning the python script first has to detect a face and then determine if it has a mask on. 
  The second part is finding the cube objects using binary masks, and then calculate the centroid and orientation of the cube.
2. Chapter 1: MASK DETECTION 
  - Set up (virtual environment and jupyter notebook)
  - Face detection (using haar features in python)
  - Mask detection (with pre-trained NN)
3. Chapter 2: CUBE DETECTION
  - Set up (virtual environment and jupyter notebook)
  - Converting to binary mask 
  - Position and orientation (based on the contour)
